# Bootstrap Form Layout Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Bootstrap to create a fully responsive registration form and a user data table.
The layout is designed to be visually appealing while ensuring usability across different screen sizes.

## Key Features
### 1. Registration Form
- **Bootstrap Form Components**: Includes fields for First Name, Last Name, Email, Password, and a Terms Agreement checkbox.
- **Grid Layout**: First Name and Last Name fields are positioned side by side using Bootstrap's grid system.
- **Form Validation**: Email and Password fields use Bootstrap validation classes to ensure required input.
- **Styled Submit Button**: A green success button (`btn-success`) enhances the formâ€™s usability.

### 2. User Data Table
- **Hardcoded Sample Data**: The table simulates user submissions with prefilled data.
- **Bootstrap Table Styling**: Implements `table-striped` and `table-hover` for improved readability.
- **Responsive Design**: Wrapped in a `table-responsive` div to ensure usability on all screen sizes.

### 3. Image Utilities
- **Full-Width Responsive Image**: Uses `img-fluid` inside a fluid container to scale properly.
- **Circular Profile Image**: A `rounded-circle` image is added for aesthetic appeal.

### 4. Button Utilities
- **Primary Action Button**: Always visible on all screens.
- **Responsive Visibility**: A secondary button is hidden on small screens (`d-none d-md-block`).

### 5. Responsive Navigation Bar
- **Bootstrap Navbar**: Includes links to Home, About, and Contact sections.
- **Collapsible Menu**: Uses `navbar-toggler` to collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens.
- **Styled for Visibility**: Custom background and link colors ensure clear navigation.

### 6. Responsive Layout & Design
- **Bootstrap Containers**: Uses `container` and `container-fluid` for structured layout.
- **Custom Styling**: Background colors, padding, and shadow effects improve aesthetics.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Layout adjusts seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## Bonus Features
- **Collapsible Navbar** for better mobile navigation.
- **Table with Hover & Stripe Effects** for improved readability.
- **Conditional Button Visibility** based on screen size.
